The Stack and the Heap: Java has two areas of memory we care about: the Stack and the Heap.
 Instance variables are variables declared inside a class but outside any method.
Local variables are variables declared inside a method or method parameter. All local variables live on the stack, in the frame corresponding to the method where the variables are declared.
Object reference variables work just like primitive variables.If the reference is declared as a local variable, it goes on the stack.
 All objects live in the heap, regardless of whether the reference is a local or instance variable.Remember that the values of an objectâ€™s instance variables live inside the object. If the instance variables are all primitives, Java makes space for the instance variables based on the primitive type. A reference variable value is not the whole object, but merely a remote control to the object.
